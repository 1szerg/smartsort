A day after a relic military jet plunged from the sky and crashed onto a busy UK highway, killing seven people, authorities will search Sunday for more possible victims.

The Cold War-era Hawker Hunter jet crashed during an air show in southeastern England.

All of those killed were on the busy A27 highway, which runs next to the Shoreham airport in Sussex, Police Superintendent Jane Derrick said.

At least 14 other people were injured.

The pilot was pulled from the wreckage and was airlifted to the Royal Sussex County Hospital, where he remained critically injured, Derrick said.

"It is possible that there are still bodies at the scene, and it is important that our search is professional and thorough," Derrick told reporters.

The jet was flying a loop at the Shoreham Airshow when it nose-dived Saturday. The highway will remain closed as the search for possible other victims continues.

The air show featured vintage military aircraft and was put on by the Sea Royal Air Force Association.


Shoreham Airshow organizers said the Sunday session of the show has been canceled following the accident.

Authorities asked anybody with still or video images of the crash to contact them.

"Sussex Police and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch have asked that anyone with photographs or video footage that may help with their investigations should send their contact details to shoreham.aircrash2015@sussex.pnn.police.uk," the airshow organizers said. "Do not send files, just contact details and information about the material you have."

About 2,000 Hawker Hunter single-seat jets were built in the 1950s in the Netherlands and Belgium, according to IHS Jane's Defense Industry. The plane's is about 46 to 49 feet long, depending on the model, with a wingspan of 33 feet 8 inches.
